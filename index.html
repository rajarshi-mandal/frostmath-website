			<p class="int" id="states">Every year from 2016 through 2023, more than 70% of the top 20 competitors at the Massachusetts MATHCOUNTS state competitions were students who used FrostMath tests to help them prepare. Those students were either on my school's team or took FrostMath classes. Joining FrostMath not only gives you access to great materials, it gives you the chance to work with some of the brightest students in Massachusetts...and with me, Coach Frost.</p>

	<!-- Introduction to Frost -->
	<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
	<p>Hi, my name is Josh Frost. For the past 20+ years, I have been preparing students for various math competitions, the largest of which has been MATHCOUNTS. For 22 of the last 24 years, the teams I have coached from my school have been MATHCOUNTS state champions. From 2001 – 2006, I coached the Cooperative Middle School in Stratham, NH to the NH state crown (including NH's best ever nationals finish of 15th in 2003), and (except for 2015 and 2018) from 2007 – 2024 (and hopefully beyond) I've coached the Jonas Clarke Middle School in Lexington, MA to state MATHCOUNTS titles. I also led the 2012, 2013, and 2019 Massachusetts MATHCOUNTS teams to winning the MATHCOUNTS National championship. In 2015 and 2018, teams of 4 kids, who all attended FrostMath, from the RJ Grey MS in Acton, defeated my own school team :-) In 2013, my school student, Alec Sun, won MATHCOUNTS nationals. In 2019, my FrostMath student, Daniel Mai was the national champion while my school student, Jeff Lin, was the written champion!</p>

	<p>Students and parents are always asking me how they can get me to work with them (or their students) to prepare for these competitions. Well, here is your chance. Beginning in the fall of 2013, I started running practices for any student in the same way I have been running them for my own team. At these practices, students take a practice MATHCOUNTS test which I have written and then we go over it both individually and as a group. The meetings run weekly (or close to weekly) and you can come every week or just on occasion given space in the class. It will be on a first come first served basis so you can register and pay as far in advance as you wish to guarantee your spot.</p>
	<!-- Past results -->
	<h1 id="results">Past Results</h1>
	<ul id="results">
		<li><p><strong class="year">2023:</strong> 14 of the top 15 finishers at the MATHCOUNTS state competition were either FrostMath students or my students at Clarke Middle School. Additionally, students with training through FrostMath made it to MATHCOUNTS Nationals in Illinois, Connecticut, and North Carolina! The Massachusetts team took 3rd at Nationals with all 4 kids placing in the top 40 and two FrostMath turned Clarke students both placing in the top 10 at Nationals.</p></li>

		<li><p><strong class="year">2022:</strong> 9 of the top 10 finishers at the MATHCOUNTS state competition were either FrostMath students or my students at Clarke Middle School. Additionally, students with training through FrostMath made it to MATHCOUNTS Nationals in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Ohio, and Oregon!!</p></li>

		<li><p><strong class="year">2021:</strong> all 12 of the top students in MA were either FrostMath students or students using the same materials at my school.</p></li>

		<li><p><strong class="year">2020:</strong> 3 of the top 4 finishers in MA were students from my school who used the FrostMath tests for 3 years (actually I met 2 of them as 5th graders in FrostMath). Only 1 of the top 9 students did NOT use the FrostMath tests as preparation.</p></li>

		<li><p><strong class="year">2019:</strong> 1st and 2nd place in MA were FrostMath students, while 9 or the top 10 kids were in the countdown wearing FrostMath shirts as either Jonas Clarke or FrostMath students (all using the same training materials).</p></li>

		<li><p><strong class="year">2018:</strong> despite 2 members of the previous year's national team and the 5th place kid from the year before still competing, kids using FrostMath practice materials took the top 8 spots at states, all of them outscoring the returning national competitors. The MA team of 4 going to nationals was made up of a student from my team and 3 kids from FrostMath!</p></li>

		<li><p><strong class="year">2017:</strong> 8 of the top 20 finishers at the MATHCOUNTS state competition were part of FrostMath for a full year (or two). Seven others in the top 20 trained with the same materials as part of my school's team. Congrats to the students from my school and from FrostMath who have done so well!!</p></li>
