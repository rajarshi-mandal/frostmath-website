		<p id="summary">The two options for taking FrostMath classes are in person classes Saturday morning from 9:00 to 11:30 in Lexington, MA or online classes via Zoom on Wednesday nights from 6:15 to 8:45. Both classes are two and a half hours long. See below for more details.</p>
		<div id="inpn">
			<h1 class="br">In-person:</h1> Each class will consist of students taking a timed "mock" MATHCOUNTS competition. That's a test that I have written and used (or will be about to use) with my own students. There are two levels of tests students can choose from. Either at the State/National MATHCOUNTS level (these are very challenging) or at the Chapter level for younger or less experienced problem solvers. After the tests are scored and returned, students will work on fixing mistakes and learning how to do problems they hadn't seen before. Students will work in groups at tables or on their own to fix these mistakes as I circulate to help answer their questions and give hints so they can discover solutions on their own.

After the tests are scored and returned, students will work on fixing mistakes and learning how to do problems they hadn't seen before. Since the class will be held online, the use of breakout rooms and chat features will be used to help individuals. Students can also be put into "breakout" video rooms to work together if they want to work with a friend on fixing problems. The online format will probably necessitate the use of a teaching assistant, usually a former student of mine who has been through my program.
